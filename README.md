
Introduction

A Data analysis project by using R, which analyzes a set of 48,009 customers, each with 7 predictive variables and 3 outcome variables.  The project performs both basic data analysis including statistical properties,  data correction, statistical validation; and statistical test between each predictive variables and outcome variables. There are four questions in this project, and four R code match up with each questions. The data-analytic-report.pdf includes all results and analysis of this project. 

Questions
* Perform a basic data analysis tasks over each predictive variable. What are their statistical properties? Are there outliers? Are any other corrections necessary? If any errors in the data are found, correct their values so your analyses would be statistically valid.

* Choose the most appropriate statistical test to study the relationship between each predictive variable and the target variable “visit”. How do you define the customer that responded to the marketing campaign with a visit?

* Working over those customers who responded to the marketing action (i.e., “visit” == 1), choose the most appropriate statistical test to study the relationship between each predictive variable and the target variable “conversion”. Define the profile(s) of the customers who made a purchase at the website, clearly differentiating them from the customers that responded to the marketing campaign, but did not purchase anything.

* For the customers that purchased something (“conversion” == 1), construct a linear regression over the relevant predictive variables and the variable “spend”. What are the significant predictors? What do they tell you about the customers that made a purchase? Study the statistical validity of your results, and discuss the qualitative information that can be extracted from your analyses. 

Requirements
* Install R studio
* Install packages ggplot2, ggthemes and plyr
* Download the source data direct_marketing.csv

Usage
* Set the folder that includes all R codes and direct_marketing.csv to root directory
* Run each R scripts one by one
